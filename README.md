# Track Suggester

#### _Epicodus Track Suggester, submitted for Epicodus code review August 10th, 2018._

### _Created by_ **Joseph Friesen**

## Description

This project consists of a single web page, containing an introductory header, a form under the heading Questionnaire, and an output panel. The user, a hypothetical prospective Epicodus that is unsure which programming language track they might pursue while at Epicodus, will enter their first and last name, complete a series of five multiple-choice questions, then submit their input. The page, using JavaScript and jQuery, will accept the user input and reveal one of three Epicodus tracks that is best suited for the user in the output panel on the right.

At the moment, the questionnaire cannot be added to, the JavaScript functions will break down if there are more than five questions. At present, I am working on making the page functionality more flexible -- the github branch better-functions where that work is taking place -- so that in the future someone could add more questions or more multiple-choice options, and the site will still return the option most appropriate.
